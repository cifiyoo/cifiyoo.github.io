## 题目
Codeforces Round #549 (Div. 2)

You are given a rooted tree with vertices numerated from 1 to n. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex named root.

Ancestors of the vertex i are all vertices on the path from the root to the vertex i, except the vertex i itself. The parent of the vertex i is the nearest to the vertex i ancestor of i. Each vertex is a child of its parent. In the given tree the parent of the vertex i is the vertex pi. For the root, the value pi is −1.

An example of a tree with n=8, the root is vertex 5. The parent of the vertex 2 is vertex 3, the parent of the vertex 1 is vertex 5. The ancestors of the vertex 6 are vertices 4 and 5, the ancestors of the vertex 7 are vertices 8, 3 and 5
You noticed that some vertices do not respect others. In particular, if ci=1, then the vertex i does not respect any of its ancestors, and if ci=0, it respects all of them.

You decided to delete vertices from the tree one by one. On each step you select such a non-root vertex that it does not respect its parent and none of its children respects it. If there are several such vertices, you select the one with the smallest number. When you delete this vertex v, all children of v become connected with the parent of v.

An example of deletion of the vertex 7.
Once there are no vertices matching the criteria for deletion, you stop the process. Print the order in which you will delete the vertices. Note that this order is unique.

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The next n lines describe the tree: the i-th line contains two integers pi and ci (1≤pi≤n, 0≤ci≤1), where pi is the parent of the vertex i, and ci=0, if the vertex i respects its parents, and ci=1, if the vertex i does not respect any of its parents. The root of the tree has −1 instead of the parent index, also, ci=0 for the root. It is guaranteed that the values pi define a rooted tree with n vertices.

Output
In case there is at least one vertex to delete, print the only line containing the indices of the vertices you will delete in the order you delete them. Otherwise print a single integer −1.
## 思路
一棵树每一个结点有唯一父节点，以及对父节点的忠诚值，0为忠诚，1为不忠诚，若一个点对于他的父节点不忠诚并且他所有的子节点对他不忠诚则把该点删除，结果从小到大输出删除的点。看完题意，我觉得不用搜索直接判断就可以，记录每一个点的孩子个数，枚举每一个点，如果当前点对父节点不忠诚，并且他的父节点对父节点也不忠诚则让他父节点的孩子个数减减，再次枚举每一个点若当前点不忠诚并且孩子数量为0 输出。实在觉得这道题不应该放在C题。
## 代码
```clike
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
struct node 
{
	int pa;
	int va;
}a[100010];
int vis[100010] = {0};
int child[100010] = {0};
int ans[100010];
int k = 0;
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    {
        cin >> a[i].pa >> a[i].va;
        child[a[i].pa]++;
    }
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        if(a[i].va == 0 || a[i].pa == -1)continue;
        else
        {
            if(a[a[i].pa].va == 1 && vis[i] == 0)
                child[a[i].pa]--,vis[i] = 1;
        }
    }
    for(int i = 1; i <=n ;i++)
    {
    	if(child[i] == 0 && a[i].va == 1)
    		ans[k++] = i;
    }
    for(int i = 0 ; i < k ; i++)
    	cout << ans[i] << " ";
    if( k == 0)cout <<-1 ;
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
