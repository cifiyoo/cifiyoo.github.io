## 题目
Codeforcrs Educational Codeforces Round 62 (Rate for Div.2)


You have a playlist consisting of n songs. The i-th song is characterized by two numbers ti and bi — its length and beauty respectively. The pleasure of listening to set of songs is equal to the total length of the songs in the set multiplied by the minimum beauty among them. For example, the pleasure of listening to a set of 3 songs having lengths [5,7,4] and beauty values [11,14,6] is equal to (5+7+4)⋅6=96.

You need to choose at most k songs from your playlist, so the pleasure of listening to the set of these songs them is maximum possible.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (1≤k≤n≤3⋅105) – the number of songs in the playlist and the maximum number of songs you can choose, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers ti and bi (1≤ti,bi≤106) — the length and beauty of i-th song.

Output
Print one integer — the maximum pleasure you can get.
## 思路
n对数，选择k组使得，sum(x)*min(y) 最大。对y从大到小排序，枚举每一个y值,将比当前y值大的所对应的x值，取负值放入优先队列(使得小的先出队)。sum加上x值，当队列的容量大于k时sum需要将出队的x值减去，maxn值记录下最大值。
## 代码
```clike
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int M = 3e5 + 5;
pair<int, int>p[M];
priority_queue<int>q;
long long n, k, sum = 0, maxn = -1;
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    cin >> n >> k;
    int x, y;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> x >> y;
        p[i] = make_pair(y, x);
    }
    sort(p, p + n);
    for(int i = n -1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        sum += p[i].second;
        q.push(-p[i].second);
        if(q.size() > k) sum += q.top(), q.pop();
        maxn = max(maxn, p[i].first * sum);
    }
    cout << maxn << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
